## QUALIFIED MVP BACKSTORY

[Link to Live Demo App - COMING SOON](https://friendly-wiles-9707cf.netlify.com/)
This MVP was inspired by Salesforce, Marketo, and Outreach.io

This project was inspired when I was a software sales rep. I wish I had a tool that graded the quality of an opportunity with numerical, quantifable metrics versus gut feelings about an opportunity.

Something similar to how Marketo grades marketing leads.
